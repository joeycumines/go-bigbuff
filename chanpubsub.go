// ChanPubSub is a pub/sub implementation that uses a channel as the underlying
// transport. This implementation's core benefits are scalability, particularly
// with arbitrarily large numbers of concurrent subscribers, and support for use
// in select statements.
//
// # Usage
//
// The [ChanPubSub.SubscribeContext] method provides a simple, [iter.Seq]-based
// (iterable) mechanism, to subscribe and consume values. If greater
// flexibility is required (e.g. it is desirable to leverage select
// statements), please ensure you understand the contract, documented below.
//
// The underlying implementation relies on strict adherence to the following
// contract:
//
//  1. The [NewChanPubSub] factory MUST be used to create instances.
//  2. Values MUST NOT be received prior to incrementing the subscriber count,
//     e.g. by calling [ChanPubSub.Add] with `1`.
//  3. Subscribers - any logical unit that receives values, after incrementing
//     the subscriber count - MUST call [ChanPubSub.Wait], immediately after
//     each value received, UNLESS the value was the result of closing the
//     underlying channel (subscribers MUST handle this case).
//  4. Subscribers MUST be able to receive then block on [ChanPubSub.Wait]
//     calls, that is, the number of subscribers MUST be exactly equal to what
//     was registered, e.g. via [ChanPubSub.Add].
//  5. [ChanPubSub.Wait] MUST NOT be called in any other circumstance.
//  6. Subscribers MAY call [ChanPubSub.Add] with a negative delta, to
//     unsubscribe, but MUST ensure that the net total remains >= 0, at all
//     times.
//  7. Subscribers MUST promptly and _continually_ operate on a cycle of
//     receiving (from [ChanPubSub.C]) then waiting (on [ChanPubSub.Wait]),
//     until such a time as they are no longer interested in receiving values,
//     in which case they MUST promptly unsubscribe. Subscribers MAY use the
//     channel in a select statement, to trigger unsubscribe, as an example.
//     After unsubscribing, values MUST NOT be received, from the channel.
type ChanPubSub[C chan V, V any] struct {
	// ping is used to orchestrate sends.

	// pongC is used to orchestrate waits.
	pongC *sync.Cond
	pongN int
	// sendMu is used to prevent concurrent sends. It serves no other purpose.
	sendMu sync.Mutex
	// sendingMu has two very important roles:
	//
	//	1. Synchronises reading subscribers then incrementing ping, with
	//	   incrementing subscribers, to avoid subscribers from stealing
	//	   messages intended for others (N.B. can still subscribe concurrently)
	//	2. Wait until ping has been incremented (if sends are in progress, i.e.
	//	   attempting to acquire or holding the write lock), or briefly
	//	   prevent sends from progressing (both are about avoiding wonky state)
	//
	// The wonky state case is of particular concern for use with buffered
	// channels, which would otherwise run the risk of decrementing ping past
	// zero, causing a panic.
